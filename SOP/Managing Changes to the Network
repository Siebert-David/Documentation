# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Managing Changes to the Network


**Date**: June 21, 2023  
**Authors**: David Prutch, Gerald Reitmeyer, Robert Gillespie, David Siebert


## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for managing changes to the network, including hardware, software, and configuration changes. This procedure ensures that network changes are implemented effectively, minimizing disruptions and maintaining the integrity and security of the network infrastructure.


## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all network administrators and personnel responsible for implementing changes to the network infrastructure within the organization.


## 3. Responsibilities
- Authorized personnel: Submit change requests with proper justification and follow the change management process.
- Network administrators: Evaluate, plan, implement, and document network changes.
- Change management team: Review and approve change requests based on established criteria.
- IT management: Provide necessary resources, support, and oversight for network change management.


## 4. Prerequisites
- Network documentation and diagrams
- Configuration management tools
- Change management software (if applicable)


## 5. Procedures


### 5.1. Change Request Submission
Authorized personnel must submit a formal change request detailing the proposed network change. The request should include the rationale, objectives, and potential impact of the change.


### 5.2. Change Evaluation
The network administrator or designated change management team evaluates the change request. Considerations include technical feasibility, resource requirements, potential risks, and alignment with organizational goals and policies.


### 5.3. Change Approval
Based on the evaluation, the change management team approves or rejects the change request. If approved, proceed to the next steps. If rejected, provide feedback and, if necessary, suggest alternatives.


### 5.4. Change Planning
Develop a detailed plan for implementing the approved network change. Consider the required hardware, software, and configuration modifications, as well as any necessary downtime or network disruption.


### 5.5. Change Testing
Before implementing the change in the production environment, conduct thorough testing in a controlled test environment. Validate the functionality, performance, and interoperability of the proposed changes.


### 5.6. Change Implementation
Schedule a maintenance window or downtime to implement the approved network change. Follow the planned implementation steps, ensuring adherence to best practices and safety protocols.


### 5.7. Change Verification
After implementing the change, verify that the intended modifications have been successfully applied. Test the network functionality and ensure that all affected systems and devices are working as expected.


### 5.8. Change Documentation
Document the details of the implemented change, including the date, time, personnel involved, and specific changes made to the network infrastructure. Update network documentation and diagrams accordingly.


### 5.9. Change Communication
Notify relevant stakeholders, such as network users or other IT teams, about the implemented network change. Provide necessary instructions or training to users, if required, to ensure a smooth transition.


### 5.10. Change Monitoring and Review
Continuously monitor the network after the change implementation to identify any potential issues or unexpected consequences. Conduct a post-implementation review to assess the success of the change and gather feedback for improvement.
