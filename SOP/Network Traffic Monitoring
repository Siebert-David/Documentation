# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Network Traffic Monitoring


**Date**: June 21, 2023  
**Authors**: David Prutch, Gerald Reitmeyer, Robert Gillespie, David Siebert


## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for monitoring network traffic in order to ensure network performance, identify potential security threats, and troubleshoot network issues effectively.


## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all network administrators and personnel responsible for monitoring network traffic within the organization.


## 3. Responsibilities
- Network administrators: Install, configure, and maintain the network monitoring software, analyze network traffic data, and perform troubleshooting activities.
- IT management: Provide necessary resources and support for network traffic monitoring initiatives.
- Network users: Cooperate with network administrators by reporting any network-related issues or anomalies promptly.


## 4. Prerequisites
- Network monitoring software (e.g., Wireshark, PRTG, SolarWinds)
- Network access and permissions


## 5. Procedures


### 5.1. Determine Monitoring Goals
Clearly define the objectives of network traffic monitoring, such as identifying bandwidth utilization, detecting anomalies, or investigating specific network issues.


### 5.2. Select Monitoring Software
Evaluate and choose a suitable network monitoring tool based on your organization's requirements and budget. Consider factors such as ease of use, functionality, and compatibility with your network infrastructure.


### 5.3. Install and Configure Monitoring Software
Follow the vendor's instructions to install the selected network monitoring software on a designated monitoring station or server. Configure the software to capture and analyze network traffic.


### 5.4. Define Monitoring Parameters
Determine the specific parameters to monitor, such as bandwidth utilization, packet loss, latency, or specific protocols. Configure the monitoring software to capture relevant network data accordingly.


### 5.5. Establish Baseline
Capture network traffic data during normal operation to establish a baseline for comparison when identifying deviations or anomalies.


### 5.6. Monitor Network Traffic
Continuously monitor network traffic using the configured monitoring software. Monitor real-time statistics, generate reports, and set up alerts for predefined threshold violations or suspicious activity.


### 5.7. Analyze and Interpret Data
Regularly review captured network traffic data to identify patterns, trends, or potential issues. Utilize filtering and analysis features of the monitoring software to focus on specific areas of interest.


### 5.8. Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution
In case of network performance issues or security incidents, utilize the captured network traffic data to troubleshoot problems, identify the root cause, and implement appropriate measures for resolution.


### 5.9. Documentation and Reporting
Maintain detailed records of network traffic monitoring activities, including observed issues, actions taken, and their outcomes. Generate periodic reports to provide insights into network performance and security to relevant stakeholders.


## 6. References
Include any relevant references or sources used to develop this SOP.


## 7. Definitions
Network Traffic: The data transmitted and received across a network infrastructure.


## 8. Revision History
