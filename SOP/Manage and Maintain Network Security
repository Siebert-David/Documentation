**Date**: June 21, 2023  
**Authors**: David Prutch, Gerald Reitmeyer, Robert Gillespie, David Siebert


## Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for managing and maintaining network security within the organization. This procedure ensures the implementation of effective security measures to protect the network infrastructure from unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats.


## Scope
This SOP applies to all network administrators and personnel responsible for managing and maintaining network security within the organization.


## Responsibilities
- Network administrators:
  - Implement and maintain network security measures.
- Security team:
  - Develop and enforce security policies, perform risk assessments, and monitor security incidents.
- IT management:
  - Provide necessary resources, support, and oversight for network security management.


## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of network security best practices and procedures.
- Access to relevant network security devices, tools, and documentation.
- Understanding of the organization's network infrastructure and security policies.


## Procedures
1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats to the network. Evaluate the impact and likelihood of each risk to prioritize mitigation efforts.


2. **Security Policies and Procedures**:
   - Develop and enforce comprehensive security policies and procedures. These should include password management, access control, network segmentation, incident response, and data encryption policies.


3. **Network Access Control**:
   - Implement strict access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the network resources. This includes user authentication, role-based access control, and secure remote access methods.


4. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Configure and maintain firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Regularly review firewall rules to ensure they align with the organization's security requirements and best practices.


5. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**:
   - Deploy and configure intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic and detect potential security breaches. Regularly update and review the IDS/IPS signatures and rules.


6. **Security Patch Management**:
   - Develop and implement a patch management process to regularly update network devices, operating systems, and software with the latest security patches and updates. This includes testing patches in a controlled environment before deployment.


7. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Utilize network monitoring tools to continuously monitor network traffic, log files, and system events. Analyze and investigate any suspicious activities or anomalies promptly.


8. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop and document an incident response plan to address security incidents effectively. Clearly define roles and responsibilities, communication channels, and escalation procedures. Regularly test and update the incident response plan.


9. **Security Awareness and Training**:
   - Conduct regular security awareness and training programs for all personnel to promote a security-conscious culture. This includes educating employees about phishing attacks, social engineering, and safe computing practices.


10. **Regular Security Audits**:
    - Perform periodic security audits to assess the effectiveness of implemented security controls, identify gaps, and recommend improvements. Engage external security experts if necessary.
