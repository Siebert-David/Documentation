**Date**: June 21, 2023  
**Authors**: David Prutch, Gerald Reitmeyer, Robert Gillespie, David Siebert

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to establish guidelines for version control of the operating system (OS) within the organization. It ensures that OS updates and patches are effectively managed, deployed, and maintained to enhance security, stability, and operational efficiency.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all system administrators and personnel responsible for managing and maintaining the OS within the organization.

## 3. Responsibilities
- System administrators: Oversee OS version control activities, including update management, deployment, and monitoring.
- IT management: Provide necessary resources, support, and guidance for OS version control initiatives.
- Users: Report any OS-related issues or anomalies promptly to the system administrators.

## 4. Prerequisites
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) 2019 installed and configured.
- Access and permissions to manage WSUS.

## 5. Procedures
### 5.1. WSUS Configuration
1. Ensure that WSUS 2019 is installed and properly configured on a designated server within the organization's network.

### 5.2. OS Update Management
1. Regularly monitor and review available OS updates and patches from official sources such as Microsoft.

2. Evaluate the significance and impact of each update based on security vulnerabilities, bug fixes, stability improvements, and compatibility with existing systems and applications.

3. Determine the appropriate update classification (critical, important, recommended) for each update based on the organization's requirements and risk assessment.

4. Test OS updates and patches in a controlled environment before deployment to production systems. Validate their compatibility and impact on existing configurations and applications.

### 5.3. OS Update Deployment
1. Create a formal path for version control within the organization, outlining the stages of testing, approval, and deployment of OS updates.

2. Develop a deployment schedule or maintenance window for installing OS updates to minimize disruption to users and business operations. Consider factors such as peak usage hours and system dependencies.

3. Utilize WSUS to deploy approved OS updates to client systems within the organization's network. Ensure WSUS server connectivity to Microsoft Update to obtain the latest update information.

4. Monitor the deployment process to ensure successful installation of OS updates on target systems. Address any failures or issues promptly and take necessary remedial actions.

### 5.4. OS Version Documentation
1. Maintain accurate records of OS versions deployed across the organization. Include details such as the OS version number, installation date, and target systems.

2. Document any specific configurations or customizations applied to the OS for reference and future updates.

### 5.5. OS Rollback and Recovery
1. Develop a contingency plan for OS rollback or recovery in case of unexpected issues or adverse effects after an OS update.

2. Establish backup and restore procedures to restore previous OS versions if necessary. Test the backup and recovery process periodically to ensure its effectiveness.

### 5.6. Version Control and Reporting
1. Implement a version control mechanism to track OS update versions and changes made during each update.

2. Generate reports on OS update status, including deployment progress, success rates, and any issues encountered. Share these reports with relevant stakeholders to provide transparency and facilitate decision-making.
